# Annual Payment Role
This is an example to calculate the Payment Amount for a credit that you request.

You just have to complete the json that I attached ( payload.json ) with your data.

And then open a terminal and execute ( node index.js ) , it will only calculate and return an example.json with everything calculated.

You just have to open it and everything will be there.

Enjoy it.
